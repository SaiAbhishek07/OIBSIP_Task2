    <h2>Missile Man of India</h2>

    <p>
      Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam was one of the most beloved and inspiring figures in Indian history. As a scientist, he contributed immensely to India’s space and missile programs, especially through his work with the ISRO and DRDO.
    </p>

    <p>
      What I adore most about Dr. Kalam is his humility, dedication to education, and deep love for his country. Despite his success, he remained grounded and believed in the power of youth and knowledge. His books like <em>"Wings of Fire"</em> and <em>"Ignited Minds"</em> continue to inspire millions.
    </p>

    <p>
      Dr. Kalam also served as the 11th President of India and was fondly known as the "People's President." He dedicated his life to teaching and motivating students, and even in his last moments, he was delivering a lecture to young minds.
